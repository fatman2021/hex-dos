<element name="TfpgBaseForm.OnCloseQuery">
<short>Occurs when close is attempted</short>
<descr><p><printshort id="TfpgBaseForm.OnCloseQuery"/>. Use OnCloseQuery to specify the conditions
under which the form can close. An OnCloseQuery event handler returns a Boolean CanClose value
that determines whether a form is allowed to close. Its default value is True.</p>
<p>You can use an OnCloseQuery event handler to ask users if they are sure they really want
the form closed immediately. For example, you can use the handler to display a message box
that prompts the user to save a file before closing the form.</p></descr>

<element name="TfpgBaseForm.OnClose">
<short>Occurs when the form closes</short>
<descr><p><printshort id="TfpgBaseForm.OnClose"/>. Use OnClose to perform special processing when
the form closes. The OnClose event specifies which event handler to call when a form is about
to close. The handler specified by OnClose might, for example, test to make sure all fields in
a data-entry form have valid contents before allowing the form to close.</p>
<p>A form is closed by the Close method or when the user chooses Close from the form's system
menu.</p>
<remark>Closing or hiding the main form terminates the application.</remark></descr>
